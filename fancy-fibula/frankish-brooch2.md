Frankish

First half of 6th century CE

L: 8.4 cm, W: 5.0 cm, D: 1.2 cm

### Description
This fibula has a semi-circular shaped head-plate with rounded extremities that are positioned in a radial pattern. On each of them there is a garnet which can symbol wealth of the owner. On the head-plate the design follows the outline of the semi-circle with perpendicular lines, and inside it is a cross-section that makes a diamond-shape pattern. The bow and body have a continuous pattern of wave-like pattern on each of the sides, and a smoothed center line with small dots. There is however a horizontal line that separates the bow and the body of the fibula. This piece is also a bit different from Frankish fibula in the collection because it has a rectangular body.
