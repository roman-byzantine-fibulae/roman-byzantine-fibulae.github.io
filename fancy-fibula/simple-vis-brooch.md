### Description
This is a simple common visigothic-style bow brooch. The head is a semi-ellipse shape with hook-like features placed in a radial-like pattern. There was also some detailing on the head-plate that appears to be worn down over time, and patterns of concentric circles on the hook-shaped features. The body has a long narrow shape that ends with a circle on the tip that also has a concentric circle design. As well as four hook-like features, two at each end with the concentric circle design. This was a relatively simple piece for the time period and has worn down quite a bit with time.
