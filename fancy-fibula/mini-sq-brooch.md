### Description
This fibula has square-head which was a popular style among the Anglo-Saxons. Even though this piece is relatively small, it still has a great amount of detailing. On the head, it keeps the rectangular pattern in the design by using lines and striping to follow the shape. In the center it also appears that at one point there was a gem that laid there. Then following down the bow to the body there is a cross-like symbol with a circle in the center at the intersection. There is more intricate pattern detailing in each quadrants of the body. At the very end of the body there is a rectangular space that appears to have held a gem at a point in time.
