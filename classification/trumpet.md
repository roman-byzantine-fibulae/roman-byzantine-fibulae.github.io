The Trumpet Fibula is actually a type of Kraftig Profiliert Fibula because it also has that high-profile bow. However these fibulae got their name because the head of the fibula flared out similarly to the bell of a trumpet. They also are a very popular variation of a Kraftig Profiliert Fibula so it has it's own unique classification. This type of fibula was worn mostly by women because they were often worn in pairs and connected by a chain. It was more of an accessory than utility.
