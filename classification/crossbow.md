The Crossbow fibula is one of the most popular and well-known fibula type. They became popular during the Imperial Period as they were mostly used in the Roman Military. However they continued to be a popular design after the Imperial period and well into the Byzantine period. There are many variations of this type of fibula as well. The variations range from the length of the spring mechanism, the amount of knobs, they style of the foot, to the 'heaviness' of the fibula. Then during the Byzantine period they contained jewels and gems, and some were even gilded with gold.
