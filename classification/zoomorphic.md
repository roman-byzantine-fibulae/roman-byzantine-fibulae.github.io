Zoomorphic fibula became popular during the Byzantine period. Earlier Zoomorphic fibulae were very different as many of them were shaped like an animal such as a horse or a bird, and a pin and catch were attached to it. Later, it became more of a design style that was carved onto the fibula. There were animal-like aspects that were applied to either the foot or the head of the fibula.
