The T-shaped fibula is named for the shape of the fibula. They are usually relatively small fibulae and have a simple construction. It has a small crossbar length at the head relative to the length of the body, which results in the T-shape. They can range from a simple design on the fibula, itself, to an intricate design with knobs and a ribbed pattern on the bow. Some of the T-shaped fibula have also been seen having a head-loop, which is an indicator that it was worn with a chain and in pairs.
