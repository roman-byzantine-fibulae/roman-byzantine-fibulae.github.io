There are many types of knee fibulae and many varieties. They are all small and have a short bow with a sharp bend, resembling a knee for which it is named. Knee fibulae are commonly found in Britain and around the Danube as well as found all the way in Syria. This type of fibula were mostly used in the Roman military which is probable because they are mostly found in regions where many forts were and the borders of the empire.
