<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This fibula has a semi-circular shaped head-plate with hook-shaped extremities positioned in a radial pattern. At each end of these pieces, they contain a garnet which can symbolize wealth. The head-plate has small detailing of dots arranged in the semi-circular pattern of the head-plate. The bow contains some ribbing on the two edges and dots following a similar linear pattern. The body is very intricately decorated with dots and lines, and follows the diamond-shape of the body. At the two vertices on the side of the diamond are two garnets, and at the bottom vertex is a final garnet shaped into a semi-circle.</p>
