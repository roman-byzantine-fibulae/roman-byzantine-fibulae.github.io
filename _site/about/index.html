<p>This exhibit will be an in-depth look at a collection of fibulae and will explore the implications they had on social status.
Now, in this case, fibulae refers to a brooch or safety pin used for fastening cloth such as a roman military cloak.
Fibulae were primarily for practical use until the rise of the Roman Empire when they started using them in their
military garb. It became a sign of status amongst the military, and modifications were made to display different levels of status
in the military. Later on, fibulae can be seen becoming more intricate and elaborate in design and even covered in jewels
and gems. However, these types of fibulae were mainly only among the wealthy because it was more of a fashion statement and a sign
of high social status. The purpose of this exhibit is to display the importance of these small objects in everyday life that
help historians to understand life back then.</p>

<p>Throughout this virtual exhibit, you can look through two collections; One of military brooches and the other of late Roman and Byzantine brooches from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. After looking at the collection you can explore the military page to learn about the role of a fibula in Roman military uniforms and how they were incorporated. Otherwise, you can explore the page on Art and Fashion to see representations of fibula in sculptures and paintings from the time period. Then you can explore the different ways fibulae were manufactured as well as understand what makes up a fibula. From there you can learn about the different types and classifications of fibula on the classifications page. Then finally taking a look at the map to check out some found locations of some of the fibulae in the collection as well as others. Click on the points on the map to explore the fibula found there.</p>
