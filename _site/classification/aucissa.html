<p>Dates: Most are found to be from the Augustan to Claudian period (10 BCE-50 CE) but can also
be found dated later during the Flavian period.</p>

<p>Some of these fibulae have the word ‘AVCISSA’ molded on the head, which is most likely the name of the manufacturer for which this type is named after. This type had a high-arch bow, and the bow was typically flat with a couple ribbed lines going down it. This is also one of the earlier fibula types so it has a simple tube hinge design as well.</p>
