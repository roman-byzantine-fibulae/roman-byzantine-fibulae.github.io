    <p>Brooches main purpose was to fasten clothing, and specifically it was a toga that was fastened at the shoulder. Since it was purely for utility purposes, it was a very simple and plain design. It was just a pin with a spring and bow, or a pin and the circular fastener. Then they started changing and becoming more and more elaborate in design. Different kinds of constructions of brooches, and different designs. They started to have lots of variations and they became more and more unique. It started this shift from the causal safety pin to an accessory. Women would start to wear them as jewelry and men would wear them as a sign of military or political status.</p>

<h2 id="womens-fashion">Women’s Fashion</h2>
<p>Women would often wear them as an accessory in later years. The common style was wearing two brooches on both shoulders connected with a chain. A common type that was often found in pairs was the Trumpet fibula. They typically had a head-loop where a chain would be thread through to connect them. This head-loop is what determined if a brooch was a part of a pair or not. Many of the Frankish brooches from the collection in this exhibition are actually part of a pair and were worn together.</p>

<p>They also would become elaborately decorated with gems and garnets, and would have a gold or silver-gilt. These decorations were more commonly from a person of wealth. Many fibulae were found in tombs and graves as a part of the deceased’s grave goods. This is where one would find women buried with gold jewelry and brooches decorated with garnets. They would even be found wearing them so there would be evidence of them found in areas near shoulders. The less wealthy tombs would have the more standard brooches made of silver, iron, or copper.</p>

<h2 id="representations-in-art">Representations in Art</h2>
<p>Most of the art that will displayed here is from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
these pieces will all display some representation of fibula from the Imperial period of Rome and the byzantine period. Throughout most of these pieces it has come to the attention
that these representations of Fibulae are mostly plate fibula even though during this time, the crossbow type and bow fibulae were the most popular. This brings up the questions:
Were circular plate-style brooches actually more popular? Or were they just the easiest option for the recreation of them in art?</p>

<h4 id="gold-solidus-of-julian"><strong><em>Gold Solidus of Julian</em></strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/462707/919585/main-image" alt="drawing" width="350" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/462707">04.35.21</a>
This is one of the few representations of fibulae where it is not a plate-style fibula.
It appears to be a possible crossbow fibula. Looking at the shoulder there is three dots and diagonal to the left appears to be another dot or rounded end. The dots can represent the knobs on the end of the head, and then the diagonal line is the body of the fibula to the rounded end which is the foot of it. This coin is from the Byzantine period so it is
understandable that there would be representation of crossbow and bow brooches because those were the most popular types at the time.</p>

<h4 id="justinian-mosaic-san-vitale"><strong><em>Justinian Mosaic San Vitale</em></strong></h4>
<p><img src="photos/justinian mosiac.jpg" alt="photo" width="550px" /></p>

<p>This is a famous mosaic from the Byzantine period, and it has great representations of
crossbow fibula being worn by the Emperor Justinian’s court. This mosaic displays the political and social status that the fibula can represent as the court is wearing heavy gold crossbow fibulae. Looking at the Emperor Justinian, he is wearing a very elaborate plate fibula covered in gems and gold. This contrast between the types of fibula and the decorations on them is parallel with the contrast in social standings in this mosaic.</p>

<h2 id="decorative-plate-fibula-representations">Decorative Plate Fibula Representations</h2>
<p>In these pieces the plate fibula were decorative and had a similar pattern throughout. They all contained a flower-like design on the brooch.</p>

This one does not have the flower design but it was still an interesting piece. However it probably was not a realistic representation of a fibula that existed, it was an interesting design choice for one that was on a bust of Jupiter.</p>
