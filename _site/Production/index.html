    <h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>They were made of various materials such as iron, lead, and most commonly Bronze.
Sometimes they are made with gold and silver, however those fibulae were more expensive
and reserved for the wealthy. There have even been some found made of bone, however this
is very rare.</p>

<h2 id="production-techniques">Production Techniques</h2>
<h3 id="forge">Forge</h3>
<p><img src="https://onthepulsenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CastMasterElite-105465-metals-beginner-blacksmith-image1.jpg" alt="drawing" width="350" /></p>
<p>This was the most common technique used to produce fibulae. This is a process of shaping
metal through hammering, pressing, and rolling. As well as a process of heating and cooling the metal while shaping.</p>

<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.numisantica.com/data/articles/images/zoom/m_12380.jpg?version=Z24we9Yi" alt="drawing" width="250" /></p>
<p>Casts were made by pouring molten metal into a clay mold consisting of two halves.</p>

<h3 id="sand-casting">Sand Casting</h3>
<p><img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/OE/VV/GLADMIN-36775973/sand-casting-500x500.png" alt="drawing" width="350" /></p>
<p>Sand casting is similar to regular casting. This process consisted of impressing a template
of the fibula into damp sand and covering it with more damp sand. When the mold dries, the
two halves with the impression of the fibula were then heated to fuse them. These molds
also had an air vent for when the molten metal is poured into it. After the metal cooled,
the two halves were separated, revealing the fibula.</p>

<h3 id="lost-wax-methods">Lost Wax Methods</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/531a2fcbe4b009ca7e475894/1524169574913-SVGNHIY02WBAX6WVE11M/Bronze-Craftmanship_US_Pouring-molten-bronze_Hardware-Renaissance.jpg?format=1500w" alt="drawing" width="350" /></p>
<p>This was the least common technique because not as many fibulas could be produced this way.
It raises the cost to produce due to the increase of materials needed to produce many, which means the price of the fibula would also increase. In this process, instead of the mold
being separated, the molten metal melts the wax.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p><img src="photos/parts of fibula.JPG" alt="photo" width="600px" style="margin-left= 100px" /></p>

<p>A fibula consists of two parts: the body and the pin. The body is the important part
of the fibula because that is the part that makes each brooch unique and classifies them.</p>
<h4 id="body">Body</h4>
<p>The body consists of a head, a bow, and the foot. The head is where the pin is attached
by a spring or hinge. The foot is where the pin fits into the catch. The head and foot are joined by the bow.</p>
<h4 id="pin">Pin</h4>
<p>The pin is the part that is actually used to fasten the clothing.</p>
