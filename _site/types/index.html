mid 1st century to mid 2nd century CE.</p>

<h4 id="t-shaped"><a href="/classification/t-shape.html">T-shaped</a></h4>

<h4 id="trumpet"><a href="/classification/trumpet.html">Trumpet</a></h4>
<p>Named because of the flared head that resembles the mouth of a trumpet. These types can
be commonly found in pairs and have head loops. This was because they were attached together by a chain and worn on both shoulders. Date range: late 1st century to mid 2nd century CE.</p>

<p>Named for the sharp knee bend at the top of the bow, representing a knee. They tend to run on the smaller side, but are still quite heavy. They have two different profile types: angular and rounded. Angular meaning it has a sharp bend and rounded meaning it is a softer bend in the bow.</p>

<h4 id="p-shaped"><a href="/classification/p-shpaed.html">P-shaped</a></h4>
