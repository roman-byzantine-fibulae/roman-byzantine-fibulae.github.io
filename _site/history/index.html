<p>Brooches are a common find at military camps because they are small objects that could easily have gotten lost or misplaced. Brooches in some cases can be just as popular to find as pottery sherds. Since they were found in abundant quantities at Roman military camps and forts, it can be suggested that they were a part of the soldiers uniform.</p>

<p>Brooches were found in the camps, in rubbish pits, ramparts, milecastles, forts, turrets, and even on the battlefields. The fibulae found in camps, forts, and milecastles suggest that they were a part of everyday wear. The ones found in the rubbish pits were mostly in pieces or broken. This can suggest that they were frequently worn and eventually broke. This can also suggest that the use of those brooches were more for the function rather than as a sign of military status. The fibulae found on the battlefields suggest that they werenâ€™t just wore casually in the camps, but also out in battle as a part of their uniform.</p>

<h3 id="roman-military-uniform">Roman Military Uniform</h3>

<p>The Roman military uniform in camp consisted of a camp dress, belted tunic, nailed sandals, and a cloak pinned on the right shoulder with a brooch. Due to the position and visibility of the brooch, it can suggest that these brooches could have had a certain significance such as military status or award medal. There were particular styles of brooches that were worn by the military: knee fibula, penannular, P-shaped, and crossbow fibulae. Knee fibulae were among the most common type to be worn, and later on in the military campaign, the Crossbow fibula came to popularity. Many knee fibula were found at Roman forts were dated between the 1st and 3rd century CE and the distribution follows the line of the Roman north western frontiers. In the 4th century CE the fibula started to become more elaborately decorated which started to become a way of signifying different members and their statuses of the Roman
military. Typically men of higher military status would wear the heavier styled crossbow brooches.</p>
