<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This fibula has square-head which was a popular style among the Anglo-Saxons. Even though this piece is relatively small, it still has a great amount of detailing. On the head, it keeps the rectangular pattern in the design by using lines follow the shape and in between the lines there are circles and swirls. In the center there is a garnet which can suggest that a wealthier person would own this. Then following down the bow to the body there is a cross-like symbol. There is more intricate pattern detailing in the top two quadrants of the body, and the bottom quadrants have faint detailing of swirls or circles. At the very end of the body there is a rectangular space that appears to have held a gem at a point in time.</p>
