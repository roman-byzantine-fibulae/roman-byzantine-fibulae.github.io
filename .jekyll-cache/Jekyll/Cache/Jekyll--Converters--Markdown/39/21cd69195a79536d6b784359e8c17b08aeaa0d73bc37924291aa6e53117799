<p>Bow brooch</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This fibula has a semi-circular shaped head-plate with rounded extremities that are positioned in a radial pattern. On each of them there is a garnet which can symbol wealth of the owner. On the head-plate the design follows the outline of the semi-circle with perpendicular lines, and inside it is a cross-section that makes a diamond-shape pattern. The bow and body have a continuous pattern of wave-like pattern on each of the sides, and a smoothed center line with small dots. There is however a horizontal line that separates the bow and the body of the fibula. This piece is also a bit different from Frankish fibula in the collection because it has a rectangular body.</p>
