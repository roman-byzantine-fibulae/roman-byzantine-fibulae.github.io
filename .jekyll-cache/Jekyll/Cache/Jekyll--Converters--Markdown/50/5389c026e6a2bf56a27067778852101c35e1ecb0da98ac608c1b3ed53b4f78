<p>Dates: Most are found to be from the Augustan to Claudian period (10 BCE-50 CE) but can also
be found dated later during the Flavian period.</p>

<p>Some of these fibulae have the word â€˜AVCISSAâ€™ molded on the head, which is most likely the name of the manufacturer for which this type is named after. This type had a high-arch bow, and the bow was typically flat with a couple ribbed lines going down it. This is also one of the earlier fibula types so it has a simple tube hinge design as well.</p>
