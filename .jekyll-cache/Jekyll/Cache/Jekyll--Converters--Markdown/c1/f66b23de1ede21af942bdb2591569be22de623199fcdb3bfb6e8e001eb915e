<p>This exhibit will be an in-depth look at a collection of fibulae and will explore the implications they had on social status.
Now, in this case, fibulae refers to a brooch or safety pin used for fastening cloth such as a roman military cloak.
Fibulae were primarily for practical use until the rise of the Roman Empire when they started using them in their
military garb. It became a sign of status amongst the military, and modifications were made to display different levels of status
in the military. Later on, fibulae can be seen becoming more intricate and elaborate in design and even covered in jewels
and gems. However, these types of fibulae were mainly only among the wealthy because it was more of a fashion statement and a sign
of high social status. The purpose of this exhibit is to display the importance of these small objects in everyday life that
help historians to understand life back then.</p>
