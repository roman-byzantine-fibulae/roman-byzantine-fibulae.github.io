<p>This fibula has a square-head head-plate. On the head-plate there is line work that follows the square shape, and in between the line work there are swirls and organic-style line work. The darken lines on the square-head and running down the body is where the niello is laid. The bow contains a lined, ribbed-like section, and the body has more geometric line work. The foot has a circular pattern and a rounded tip with some small line and dot work.</p>
