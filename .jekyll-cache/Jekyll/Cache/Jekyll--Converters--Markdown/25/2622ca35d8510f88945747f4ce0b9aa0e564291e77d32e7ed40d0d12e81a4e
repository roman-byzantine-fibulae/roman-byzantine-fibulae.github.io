<p>The P-shaped fibula, similar to the Kraftig Profiliert fibula has a “high Profile” bow. The bow  is typically shaped like a half-circle and well-rounded. The major difference here, is the long foot. The foot can be long and flat with the catch at the end. The flatness of the foot allows for some design patterns such as circle engravings to appear. On the other hand, it could also be one long catch with no design. This allows there to be two main variations of this type of fibula.</p>
